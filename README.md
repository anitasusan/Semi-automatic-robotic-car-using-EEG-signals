# Semi-automatic-robotic-car-using-EEG-signals
This project is a work in progress which focuses on creating a semi-automatic car which is controlled using eeg signal analysis.
Car signals are controlled bu employing SSVEP paradigm to create a BCI system in which frequencies are translated into computer commands.
The robotic car is developed using Arduino and is connected to the computer using bluetooth.
The files attached containt the developed GUI interface as well as the pre-processing and feature extraction tool used for its analysis.
The data is recorded using Emotiv with 14 channels.
